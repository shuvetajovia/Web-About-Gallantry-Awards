  <h1>🕊️ Peacetime Gallantry Awards</h1>
  <p>For those who fought fear, not war — and won our hearts</p>
</header>

<!-- 30-Line Emotional Intro -->
<section>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">🇮🇳 Courage Beyond the Battlefield</h2>
  <p>Bravery isn’t just born on the battlefield — it shines in moments when life demands selfless action. India’s <strong>Peacetime Gallantry Awards</strong> recognize such heroes who perform incredible acts of courage even outside declared wars.</p>
  <p>These awards are presented for bravery in counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, rescue missions, natural disasters, hostage situations, and other peacetime threats where lives are at stake.</p>
  <p>The highest among them is the <strong>Ashoka Chakra</strong>, followed by the <strong>Kirti Chakra</strong> and the <strong>Shaurya Chakra</strong>. Together, they represent honor, sacrifice, and an unshaken commitment to duty.</p>
  <p>From the narrow corridors of a besieged Mumbai hotel during the 26/11 attacks to hijacked airplanes, war-torn villages, and volatile borders — these heroes chose courage over fear.</p>
  <p><strong>Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan</strong>, who told his team “Do not come up, I’ll handle them,” before laying down his life during the Taj operation.</p>
  <p><strong>Neerja Bhanot</strong>, the young air hostess who shielded passengers from bullets and terrorists aboard a hijacked flight.</p>
  <p><strong>Hangpan Dada</strong>, <strong>Lt. Navdeep Singh</strong>, <strong>Rakesh Singh</strong>, and <strong>Lt. Col. Niranjan</strong> — their names might not be in every textbook, but their sacrifice defines true patriotism.</p>
  <p>These gallant souls didn’t fight wars — they fought fear. And they won, not just medals, but a place in the heart of Bharat.</p>

    He ensured the safety of his fellow soldiers and successfully rescued several local residents during the fierce exchange of fire. His calm leadership and unwavering commitment to duty reflect the highest traditions of the Indian Army. A former TCS employee and IIM graduate, Mukund chose a life of service in uniform.

  <h2>🇮🇳 Conclusion</h2>
