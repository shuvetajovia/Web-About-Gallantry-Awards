    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/somnath_sharma.jpeg" alt="Major Somnath Sharma">
    <p>
      <strong>Major Somnath Sharma</strong> was posthumously awarded India’s first Param Vir Chakra for his unmatched bravery during the 1947 Indo-Pak War.

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/vikram_batra.jpeg" alt="Captain Vikram Batra">
    <p>
      <strong>Captain Vikram Batra</strong>, PVC awardee from the Kargil War (1999), became a national icon. His code name “Shershah” matched his fearless personality. He led his troops to capture Point 5140 and later laid down his life while saving a fellow soldier during the assault on Point 4875. His famous words “Yeh Dil Maange More” still echo in every patriot's heart.
    </p>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/yogendra_yadav.jpeg" alt="Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav">
    <p>
      <strong>Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav</strong> received the PVC for his heroic actions during the Kargil War at Tiger Hill. Climbing a vertical cliff under heavy firing, he was hit by 15 bullets but still neutralized enemy bunkers. He is one of the youngest living recipients of the PVC.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Maha Vir Chakra (MVC)</h2>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/arun_khetarpal.jpeg" alt="Lt. Arun Khetarpal">
    <p>
      <strong>Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal</strong> of the Indian Army was posthumously awarded the MVC during the 1971 Indo-Pak War. Just 21 years old, he destroyed enemy tanks in the Battle of Basantar. Refusing to abandon his tank even when fatally wounded, he died fighting with unmatched bravery.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/mohammad_usman.jpeg" alt="Brigadier Mohammad Usman">
    <p>
      <strong>Brigadier Mohammad Usman</strong>, known as the "Lion of Nowshera", was awarded the MVC for his leadership in recapturing Jhangar during the 1947 war. He refused to move from the front lines and was killed by artillery fire. He remains one of the highest-ranking Indian Army officers martyred in battle.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Vir Chakra</h2>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/nirmaljit_sekhon.jpeg" alt="Flight Lt. Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon">
    <p>
      <strong>Flight Lieutenant Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon</strong> was the only Air Force officer to be awarded the Vir Chakra during the 1971 war. He fought off six Pakistani Sabre jets single-handedly over Srinagar and was martyred in combat. His sacrifice saved countless lives and installations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/abdul_hamid.jpeg" alt="Company Quartermaster Havildar Abdul Hamid">
    <p>
      Though a PVC recipient, <strong>Company Quartermaster Havildar Abdul Hamid</strong> deserves a mention for his legendary tank-killing spree during the 1965 war. Using a recoilless rifle, he destroyed three Patton tanks before he was martyred. His courage turned the tide at the Battle of Asal Uttar.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="officer">
    <img src="wartime_soldiers_pic/major_shaitan_singh.jpeg" alt="Major Shaitan Singh">
    <p>
      Another PVC legend, <strong>Major Shaitan Singh</strong> fought to the last man during the 1962 Sino-Indian War at Rezang La. His leadership inspired 114 soldiers to fight nearly 1,000 Chinese troops. Only a handful survived, but their heroism became history.

  <h2>Legacy and Inspiration</h2>
  <p>
    Wartime gallantry awards are more than decorations — they’re India’s heartbeat. Each award tells a tale of unimaginable bravery, of soldiers who chose duty over life. These heroes — known and unknown — form the soul of India’s military tradition. Their lives inspire generations to come, reminding us that freedom isn't free — it's earned by blood, sacrifice, and service.
