  <!-- Wartime Gallantry Awards -->
  <h3>⚔️ Wartime Gallantry Awards</h3>
  <p>
    Wartime Gallantry Awards are given for fearless acts on the battlefield against the enemy. The highest of them all is the <strong>Param Vir Chakra</strong>, followed by the <strong>Maha Vir Chakra</strong> and <strong>Vir Chakra</strong>.
    Major Somnath Sharma was the first PVC awardee during the 1947 Kashmir War. Captain Vikram Batra, who famously said “Yeh Dil Maange More”, sacrificed his life during the Kargil War while capturing Point 4875.
    Subedar Yogendra Singh Yadav climbed a vertical cliff under machine gun fire to clear bunkers during the same war — and survived with 15 bullet injuries.
    Lance Naik Albert Ekka destroyed enemy positions during the 1971 Indo-Pak War and received the PVC posthumously.
    These brave soldiers show us that courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.
    Every medal awarded in war is a symbol of India’s spirit — unyielding, determined, and full of fire.
    These awards continue to inspire generations of youth to serve the nation with valor and pride.
  </p>

  <!-- Peacetime Gallantry Awards -->
  <h3>🕊️ Peacetime Gallantry Awards</h3>
  <p>
    These awards are given for acts of courage away from war — during anti-terror operations, disaster rescues, or peace missions. The highest is the <strong>Ashoka Chakra</strong>, followed by <strong>Kirti Chakra</strong> and <strong>Shaurya Chakra</strong>.
    Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan received the Ashoka Chakra posthumously for saving lives during the 26/11 Mumbai attacks. His last words — “Don’t come up, I’ll handle them” — are etched in the nation’s heart.
    Neerja Bhanot, a 23-year-old flight attendant, died saving passengers from terrorists on Pan Am Flight 73. Her courage earned her the Ashoka Chakra.
    Havildar Hangpan Dada of Assam Rifles was awarded posthumously for killing four militants in Kupwara despite being critically wounded.
    These awards prove that heroism is not confined to battlefields — it lives in selfless service.
    India salutes these everyday warriors who walk into danger so others can walk out safely.
  </p>

  <!-- Additional Gallantry Medals -->
  <h3>💡 Additional Gallantry Medals</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond the major gallantry awards, India also honors service-specific heroes with medals like the <strong>Sena Medal</strong> (Army), <strong>Nao Sena Medal</strong> (Navy), and <strong>Vayu Sena Medal</strong> (Air Force).
    These medals recognize acts of individual courage, distinguished service, and operational excellence.
    Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, famous for downing a Pakistani F-16 and facing captivity with honor, received the Vir Chakra — and was also a national icon.
    The Sena Medal has honored soldiers like Naib Subedar Sanjay Kumar (PVC awardee too) and others who have led successful missions.
    These awards also cover operations like surgical strikes, border patrol bravery, and explosive handling.
    Even junior commissioned officers and non-commissioned personnel are regularly awarded for daring missions.
    These medals may not always make headlines, but they are the backbone of our defense forces’ honor system.

  <!-- Notable Statistics -->
  <h3>🛡️ Notable Statistics</h3>
  <p>
    Since Independence, India has awarded <strong>21 Param Vir Chakras</strong> — the highest wartime honor.
    The <strong>Ashoka Chakra</strong>, the highest peacetime honor, has over 80 recipients, with many awarded posthumously.
    Maharashtra, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh are among the top states producing gallantry awardees.
    A majority of these awards are given to soldiers under 30, proving that youth are India's true power.
    The <strong>Kargil War</strong> alone witnessed over 50 gallantry medals, including 4 Param Vir Chakras.
    The 1971 Indo-Pak war also saw a surge in MVC and Vir Chakra recognitions.
    Many gallantry medals have been conferred on brave women, police, and civilians as well.
    These numbers are not just data — they are stories of bravery, patriotism, and supreme sacrifice.
